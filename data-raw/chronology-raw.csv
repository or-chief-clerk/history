Both branches of the legislature met at Salem on July 5, remaining in session four days. Because there was doubts as to whether Oregon had yet been admitted, owing to the impossibility of direct and speedy communication with the national capital, it was decided to adjourn until September of the same year. On September 13 part of the members of both branches of the legislature assembled at the Capitol. It appearing that the State had not yet been admitted again so they adjourned. The Territorial Legislature, as had been its usual custom, then convened in December 6, 1858, and transacted the business of the State as usual during the session, which lasted until January 22, 1859",Session : 1858 Session (33)
